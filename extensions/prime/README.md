## Borzoi Prime - Predicting 3'-scRNA-seq coverage profiles across many cell types

This directory contains code for training and evaluating Borzoi Prime, a neural network that predicts pseudo-bulk scRNA-seq coverage profiles from DNA sequence. Pre-trained model weights and relevant data are also available and linked below.

See [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calico/borzoi-paper/main/extensions/prime/examples/targets_human.txt) for a list of human coverage profiles, and [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calico/borzoi-paper/main/extensions/prime/examples/targets_mouse.txt) for mouse coverage profiles.

### Model Availability
